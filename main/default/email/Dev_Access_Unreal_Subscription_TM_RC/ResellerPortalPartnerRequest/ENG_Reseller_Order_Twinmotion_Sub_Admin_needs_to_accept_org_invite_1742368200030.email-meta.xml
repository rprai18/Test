    <textOnly>Thank you for submitting your Twinmotion annual subscription order.

We have prepared or updated an organization record for the customer and applied the specified quantity of Twinmotion annual subscription licenses. 
 - Organization ID: {{{Partner_Request__c.Org_Id__c}}} 
 - for Epic/Partner internal purposes only - no need to share with customer

NOTE: Since the customer&apos;s listed license administrator did not already have an Epic Games Account, we have prepared their organization with a placeholder owner, and issued them an invitation to join the organization and create their Epic Games Account in the process. This is mentioned in the customer information below.

You are welcome to share the below information with the customer&apos;s license administrator.

Thanks
